## Changes to Existing Features

### Release Infrastructure Improvements

- **Coordinated monorepo release**: All 13 packages now version-aligned at v20.0.0-beta.1
  - Previously, packages had different version numbers (1.0.x, 2.0.x, etc.)
  - Now all packages share the same major version for easier tracking
  - Simplifies dependency management and compatibility

- **Enhanced publish script** (`scripts/publish-all.sh`):
  - Added `--tag` parameter support for beta/rc releases
  - Improved verification with retry logic (handles npm registry propagation delays)
  - Better error messages and user prompts
  - Publishes all packages in correct dependency order

- **Improved release documentation**:
  - Added structured release process in RELEASE_PROCESS.md
  - Release notes now serve as beta testing checklist
  - Clear workflow: beta → test → iterate → finalize → production

### What Users Should Notice

- **More reliable installations**: Improved package publishing reduces installation errors
- **Consistent versioning**: Easier to track which versions work together
- **Better error handling**: More informative error messages during package installation

## Notes

This release focuses on infrastructure improvements to support safer, more reliable releases. The version bump to v20.0.0 establishes a new baseline for coordinated releases across the monorepo.

**Why test this beta:**
- Verify the version alignment doesn't introduce any unexpected issues
- Ensure all integrations still work correctly with the new package structure
- Confirm that the improved publishing process results in reliable installations

**Expected behavior:**
- Should work identically to v17.0.3 for all user-facing functionality
- All existing tools, prompts, and configurations should work unchanged
- No migration or configuration changes required
